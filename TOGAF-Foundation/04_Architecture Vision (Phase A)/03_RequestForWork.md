1. **Purpose of the Request for Architecture Work**:

   * This document is a **high-level** overview sent by the **sponsoring organization** to the **architecture organization**.
   * It marks the formal **initiation** of an architecture development cycle.
   * It can be the output of an **approved architecture change request** or originate from **migration planning**.

2. **Contents of the Request for Architecture Work**:

   * **Organization Sponsor’s Mission Statement**: Describes the **mission** and strategic goals of the organization.
   * **Business Goals and Objectives**: Information on business strategies, including any planned changes or shifts in direction.
   * **Strategic Plans and Changes in Business Environment**: This covers the **strategic objectives** of the organization and how they relate to the evolving business landscape (e.g., new technologies, market changes, etc.).
   * **Budget Information and Constraints**: Any **financial constraints** or resource limitations that could impact the architecture work.
   * **Business Systems and IT Systems Description**: A **high-level overview** of current systems and infrastructure, detailing what is being transformed or updated in the architecture.
   * **Time Limits and Deadlines**: Any **timeframe** or **milestones** that need to be considered during the architecture development.
   * **Constraints**: Specific limitations that need to be considered (e.g., regulatory constraints, resource constraints, or technology limitations).

3. **Developing Organization**:

   * This section includes information about the **resources available** for the architecture development, such as teams, tools, and technologies that will be used.

### **Steps in Phase A – Architecture Vision** (Related to Request for Architecture Work):

1. **Establish the Architecture Project**: Initiating the **architecture project** by forming a team and establishing governance structures.
2. **Identify Stakeholders, Concerns, and Business Requirements**: Mapping out the **stakeholders**, their concerns, and the **business requirements** that will guide the architecture design.
3. **Confirm and Elaborate Business Goals, Business Drivers, and Constraints**: Defining and elaborating on the **business goals**, **drivers**, and any **constraints** impacting the architecture development.
4. **Evaluate Capabilities**: Reviewing current **organizational capabilities** (people, technology, processes) and aligning them with the desired future state.
5. **Assess Readiness for Business Transformation**: Assessing if the organization is ready for the **business transformation** that will result from the architecture.
6. **Define Scope**: Establishing the **scope** of the architecture effort, ensuring alignment with business objectives.

The diagram you provided highlights the **relationship between different phases and processes** within TOGAF, especially focusing on the **Preliminary Phase**, **Phase A (Architecture Vision)**, and how they interact with other phases like **Architecture Change Management**, **Business Architecture**, **Technology Architecture**, and **Requirements Management**.

### **Key Points from the Diagram:**

1. **The Deliverable in the Preliminary Phase**:

   * The **Request for Architecture Work** is created during the **Preliminary Phase** and is essential for initiating the architecture development cycle.
   * The **Request for Architecture Work** serves as a **terms of reference** for the architecture work, outlining objectives and governance.
   * It can also be generated as a result of **approved Architecture Change Requests**.

2. **Architecture Vision (Phase A)**:

   * **Phase A: Architecture Vision** is where the architecture vision is created, and it becomes the **starting point** for the entire architecture project.
   * It **receives inputs** from multiple other domains:

     * **Business Architecture**: Describes the business processes, goals, and needs that the architecture aims to fulfill.
     * **Technology Architecture**: Provides insight into the technology landscape and capabilities required to support the business goals.
     * **Information Systems Architectures**: Focuses on the data and applications that need to be addressed by the architecture.
     * **Opportunities and Solutions**: Explores potential technological solutions and opportunities.
     * **Requirements Management**: Ensures that all **business, technical, and operational requirements** are properly captured and addressed in the architecture.

3. **Use of the Deliverable in Other Phases**:

   * **Phase F: Migration Planning**, **Phase G: Implementation Governance**, and **Phase H: Architecture Change Management** all use inputs from **Requirements Management** and the **Architecture Vision** to align the architecture development with business goals and ensure it evolves as per the business’s changing needs.

4. **Output Creation and Input Utilization**:

   * The **Request for Architecture Work** is created as an **output** by the **sponsoring organization**, which is then received by the architecture organization as an **input** to drive the architecture project forward.
   * This document serves as a **key deliverable** that integrates input from multiple domains (business, technology, systems, and more).

### **How This Fits into the Overall ADM Process:**

* **Preliminary Phase**:

  * This phase is essential for setting up the **architecture governance**, establishing **key principles**, and defining **scope**.
  * The **Request for Architecture Work** is a deliverable of this phase, which outlines the project goals and structure.

* **Phase A: Architecture Vision**:

  * The **architecture vision** serves as the overarching **strategy** for the architecture and helps in setting the **target state**.
  * This vision must align with various architectural domains like business, technology, and information systems.

* **Subsequent Phases** (such as **Phase B**, **Phase C**, and **Phase D**):

  * These phases use inputs from the **Architecture Vision**, **Requirements Management**, and other domains to flesh out the detailed architecture designs.
  * **Architecture Change Management** in **Phase H** ensures that the architecture adapts to changes in business, technology, and operational environments.

---

### **Takeaways:**

* The **Request for Architecture Work** is a **critical document** that triggers the architecture development cycle and aligns the organization with the architecture strategy.
* The **Architecture Vision** in **Phase A** is informed by inputs from different areas, like business and technology architectures, and becomes a foundation for the detailed work done in the later phases.
* The **Preliminary Phase** provides the organizational context, scope, and principles, while Phase A focuses on aligning architecture with business goals.
