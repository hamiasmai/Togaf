### **ADM Phase A: Architecture Vision – Communications Plan**

The communications plan plays a crucial role in ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are informed, engaged, and aligned with the architecture vision and objectives throughout the project. The **communications plan** is directly derived from the **stakeholder map**, which is a key component in Phase A.

---

### **Key Steps in the Communications Plan for Phase A:**

1. **Establish the Architecture Project**

   * **Goal:** Formally kick off the architecture project by defining roles, responsibilities, and governance structures.
   * This step ensures that everyone knows **who is involved** and **what their roles** are within the architecture development cycle. It also sets the stage for how the architecture will be managed and governed.

2. **Identify Stakeholders, Concerns, and Business Requirements**

   * **Goal:** Identify and categorize the **stakeholders**, their **concerns**, and **business requirements**.
   * The **stakeholder map** is crucial here, as it helps identify:

     * **Who the stakeholders are** (business leaders, IT, end users, etc.).
     * **What their concerns** are (e.g., cost, performance, security).
     * **What their business requirements** are (e.g., scalability, integration, agility).
   * This mapping is foundational for aligning the architecture work with organizational needs and ensuring all concerns are addressed.

3. **Confirm and Elaborate Business Goals, Business Drivers, and Constraints**

   * **Goal:** Ensure that the architecture work is aligned with the **business goals** and addresses the **drivers** and **constraints**.
   * This step involves a deep dive into:

     * **Business goals**: What are the key objectives the organization wants to achieve? For instance, reducing costs, improving customer experience, etc.
     * **Business drivers**: What forces are pushing the organization to adopt architectural changes (e.g., market competition, new technology, regulations)?
     * **Constraints**: What limitations exist (e.g., budget, time, compliance)?

4. **Evaluate Capabilities**

   * **Goal:** Assess the current **capabilities** and determine what is needed to meet business goals.
   * This involves understanding the **current state** (technological, organizational, and business processes) and identifying any gaps in capabilities that must be addressed to meet the strategic objectives.

5. **Assess Readiness for Business Transformation**

   * **Goal:** Evaluate the organization’s **readiness** for transformation.
   * This step assesses whether the organization has the resources, commitment, and cultural mindset to support the changes that the architecture will bring. It ensures that any potential barriers to change are identified early.

6. **Define Scope**

   * **Goal:** Clearly define the **scope** of the architecture work.
   * This includes identifying which areas of the business or IT landscape will be impacted and detailing the **boundaries** of the architecture development effort. Properly defining scope helps avoid scope creep and ensures the project stays focused.

### **Communication Plan Derived from the Stakeholder Map**

A **well-developed communication plan** ensures that information flows efficiently to all the relevant stakeholders, and helps in managing expectations. The **stakeholder map** is the starting point for defining who needs to be kept informed, consulted, or involved at different stages of the architecture work.

* **Internal Communication:**

  * Regular updates with key stakeholders (business units, IT teams, senior leadership) about project progress, key decisions, and risks.
* **External Communication:**

  * If applicable, communicating with external vendors, partners, or regulatory bodies to ensure alignment with the external environment.
* **Tailored Communication:**

  * Communication should be customized based on **stakeholder interests and concerns** (e.g., executive summaries for senior leadership, technical details for architects, etc.).

### **Conclusion:**

Phase A is critical for setting the direction of the architecture project, and the communications plan derived from the stakeholder map helps ensure that all stakeholders are properly aligned, informed, and involved. It ensures that the architecture vision, goals, and the transformation process are clearly communicated to everyone involved.

In TOGAF ADM, the **Architecture Vision** phase includes defining the **scope, stakeholders, communication, and high-level goals** of the architecture project. The communication plan shown in the image helps ensure all stakeholders are aligned.

Here’s how this communication plan ties to the **TOGAF ADM Architecture Vision**:

### 1. Purpose in Architecture Vision

* Defines **who** the stakeholders are.
* Clarifies **what** information will be communicated.
* Specifies **how** communication will take place (channels, documents, meetings).
* Outlines **when** communication happens (frequency, milestones).

### 2. Key Components 

* **Front Page**: Project/Client identifiers → aligns with *Architecture Vision* project scoping.
* **Table of Contents & Document Control**: Ensures governance and traceability → supports TOGAF’s *Enterprise Continuum* principles.
* **Stakeholders Section**: Identifies stakeholders, their concerns, and required communications → aligns directly with TOGAF’s *Stakeholder Management* technique.

### 3. Alignment with TOGAF Outputs

In the **Architecture Vision phase**, one of the expected deliverables is the **Communications Plan**, which ensures that:

* Business sponsors and stakeholders understand the project scope and objectives.
* Architects can manage stakeholder expectations effectively.
* Risks due to miscommunication are minimized.

✅ So in short: This communication plan is an **essential output** of the **Architecture Vision phase** of TOGAF ADM, ensuring that stakeholder concerns are addressed early and continuously throughout the architecture development cycle.

## **Communications Plan in TOGAF ADM**

### **1. Created in Phase A (Architecture Vision)**

* The Communications Plan is first **developed in Phase A**.
* Purpose: Define **where, how, and when Enterprise Architects will communicate with stakeholders**.
* Ensures stakeholders’ concerns are captured early and managed throughout the lifecycle.

---

### **2. Usage in Subsequent Phases (B → F)**

Once created, the plan acts as a **reference and input** across the architecture phases:

* **Phase B (Business Architecture)** → Use plan as input to engage business stakeholders and validate requirements.
* **Phase C (Information Systems Architectures)** → Use plan as input to communicate with application/data stakeholders.
* **Phase D (Technology Architecture)** → Use plan as input to align with infrastructure/technology stakeholders.
* **Phase E (Opportunities & Solutions)** → Use plan as input for solution selection and stakeholder buy-in.
* **Phase F (Migration Planning)** → Use plan as input to align transition stakeholders and ensure readiness.

---

### **3. Continued Use Beyond Phase F**

* **Phase G (Implementation Governance):** Supports communication of implementation progress, risks, and compliance.
* **Phase H (Architecture Change Management):** Ensures ongoing communication with stakeholders when changes occur.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* **Create in Phase A** (Architecture Vision).
* **Use as input in Phases B–F** for architecture development and planning.
* **Support in Phases G–H** for governance and change management.
