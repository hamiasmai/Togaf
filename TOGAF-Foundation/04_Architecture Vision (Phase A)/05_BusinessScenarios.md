## **ADM Phase A: Architecture Vision – Key Business Scenario Steps**

1. **Establish the Architecture Project**

   * Define project scope, objectives, and stakeholders.
   * Align with enterprise strategies.

2. **Identify Stakeholders, Concerns, and Business Requirements**

   * Determine **who** is impacted, **what concerns** they have, and **what requirements** must be addressed.
   * This is where the **Communications Plan** directly supports identifying and engaging stakeholders.

3. **Confirm and Elaborate Business Goals, Drivers, and Constraints**

   * Validate with stakeholders the **goals** of the transformation.
   * Capture **business drivers** (e.g., growth, compliance, cost reduction) and **constraints** (budget, regulations, time).

4. **Evaluate Capabilities**

   * Assess current business and IT capabilities.
   * Identify strengths, weaknesses, and improvement areas.

5. **Assess Readiness for Business Transformation**

   * Evaluate organizational readiness.
   * Look at culture, governance, and skills to support change.

6. **Define Scope**

   * Clarify **what is included** and **what is excluded** in the architecture engagement.
   * Provides input to the **Statement of Architecture Work**.

## **Why Business Scenarios Matter**

* They provide **real-world context** for business requirements.
* They connect **stakeholder concerns** with **architecture solutions**.
* They ensure the Architecture Vision is **anchored in actual business needs**.

---

✅ **Summary**:
In Phase A, business scenarios are used to:

* **Identify stakeholders and requirements** (Step 2).
* **Validate goals and constraints** (Step 3).
* **Support defining scope and readiness** for the transformation.


## **Business Scenarios – Definition (TOGAF)**

A **Business Scenario** is a **technique used to identify, document, and understand business needs**.
It translates **high-level business requirements** into **characteristics of the architecture** needed to achieve **desired business outcomes**.

---

### **Key Characteristics**

* **Business value driven:** Looks at outcomes, value streams, and the benefits for the enterprise.
* **Resource-focused:** Identifies people, processes, systems, and technologies required.
* **Scalable application:** Can apply to:

  * **Large, complex domains** (e.g., national healthcare system standards, transportation infrastructure).
  * **Small, focused domains** (e.g., retail point-of-sale upgrades).

---

### **Purpose**

* Provides a **bridge between business and IT**.
* Ensures architecture is **rooted in real business requirements**.
* Helps stakeholders see **how architecture changes deliver value**.

---

### **When to Use**

* In **Phase A: Architecture Vision**, to clarify business drivers and needs.
* Throughout **Phases B–D** (Business, Information Systems, Technology Architectures), to refine requirements and validate designs.

---

✅ **Summary:**
Business Scenarios **capture business needs in context** → derive **architecture characteristics** → enable **enterprise architects** to design solutions that deliver measurable **business outcomes**.
