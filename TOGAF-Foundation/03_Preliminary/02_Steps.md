| **1**    | **Scope the enterprise organizations impacted**                         | Define **where** the architecture will apply.                                |
| **2**    | **Confirm governance and support frameworks**                           | Define **what** frameworks and governance structures are already in place.   |
| **3**    | **Define and establish the EA team and organization**                   | Define **who** will do the architecture work.                                |
| **4**    | **Identify and establish Architecture Principles**                      | Define **why** the architecture exists ‚Äî i.e., the principles that guide it. |
| **5**    | **Tailor the TOGAF framework** and other selected frameworks            | Define **how** the architecture will be delivered and governed.              |
| **6**    | **Develop a strategy and implementation plan for tools and techniques** | Set up the **how** (tools, methods, support structures).                     |
