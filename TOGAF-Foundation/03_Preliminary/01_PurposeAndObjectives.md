## 🏛️ TOGAF ADM – **Preliminary Phase** Cheatsheet

---

### 🎯 **Purpose of the Preliminary Phase**

The **Preliminary Phase** creates the **Architecture Capability** for an enterprise by:

1. Performing **preparation and initiation** activities.
2. **Customizing the TOGAF framework** to fit the organization.
3. Defining the **Architecture Principles**.

---

### 🎯 **Objectives of the Preliminary Phase**

The phase determines the **target maturity level** and **establishes the Architecture Capability**.

---

### ✅ **Objective 1: Determine the Architecture Capability Desired by the Organization**

| Step | Description                                                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.1  | **Review the organizational context** for conducting Enterprise Architecture (EA).          |
| 1.2  | **Identify and scope** the parts of the enterprise affected by the Architecture Capability. |
| 1.3  | Identify **existing frameworks, methods, and processes** that intersect with EA.            |
| 1.4  | Establish a **Capability Maturity Target** (to assess and guide EA maturity).               |

### ✅ **Objective 2: Establish the Architecture Capability**

| Step | Description                                                                                                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2.1  | Define and establish the **Organizational Model** for Enterprise Architecture (roles, responsibilities, structure). |
| 2.2  | Define detailed **Architecture Governance** processes and resources.                                                |
| 2.3  | Select and implement **tools** that support the Architecture Capability.                                            |
| 2.4  | Define the **Architecture Principles** to guide architectural work.                                                 |
