### 🎯 **What are Architecture Principles?**

> Architecture Principles are **fundamental rules and guidelines** developed in the **Preliminary Phase** to **guide the development, maintenance, and use of the Enterprise Architecture (EA)**.

---

### ✅ **Purpose of Architecture Principles**

Architecture Principles:

1. **Guide architecture development** as part of the **Principles Catalog**.
2. Define the **general rules** for **resource and asset usage**.
3. Form the **basis for architectural decisions**.
4. Are **enduring** and **seldom amended**.
5. Reflect a **consensus** among stakeholders.
6. Link back to **business objectives and architecture drivers**.
7. Are influenced by:

   * Industry trends
   * Mission and strategy
   * Current systems and technologies
   * External constraints
8. Provide the **foundation for planning, conflict resolution, policies, and standards**.
9. Are developed by **EA teams** in collaboration with stakeholders and approved by the **Architecture Board**.
10. Can be **amended** through a formal process.
11. Are **few in number**, **future-oriented**, and **endorsed by senior management**.

### 🏛️ **Principle Hierarchy**

| Level                                 | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Enterprise Principles**          | Broadest level; set boundaries for all lower-level principles.                                                    |
| **2. Domain Principles**              | Expand and detail the enterprise principles for specific domains (e.g., business, data, application, technology). |
| **3. Organizational Unit Principles** | Tailored for departments or business units; must align with higher levels.                                        |

> 📌 **Rule**: A lower-level principle **cannot contradict** a higher-level principle.

### 🧭 **Principle Domains**

Principles can exist in various domains:

| Domain                       | Focus                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enterprise**               | Guide decision-making enterprise-wide; align with mission and governance. |
| **Business Unit / Org Unit** | Specific to operational units; inherit and refine enterprise principles.  |
| **Architecture Domains**     | Business, Data, Application, and Technology architecture.                 |

### 📋 **Structure of an Architecture Principle**

| Element          | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**         | Simple and memorable essence of the principle.                               |
| **Statement**    | Clear, unambiguous rule or policy.                                           |
| **Rationale**    | Why the principle exists – business benefits and supporting logic.           |
| **Implications** | What it means in practice – actions, costs, and how it affects stakeholders. |

### 📝 **Example: Business Principle**

#### 📌 Name: **Compliance with Law**

* **Statement**:
  Enterprise information management processes comply with all relevant laws, policies, and regulations.

* **Rationale**:
  The enterprise must follow the law to operate responsibly and avoid legal issues.

* **Implications**:

  * Legal compliance affects how data is collected, stored, and managed.
  * Staff must be trained and systems updated when laws change.
  * Business processes may need to adapt to regulatory changes.

### 🔍 **Differences Between Rationale & Implications**

| Rationale                                           | Implications                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explains **why** the principle exists               | Describes **how** it affects stakeholders               |
| Relates to **business benefit** and **consistency** | Defines **requirements**, **costs**, and **activities** |
| Helps interpret the principle consistently          | Answers: "**How does this affect me?**"                 |
