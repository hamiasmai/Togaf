The **Preliminary Phase** in TOGAF's Architecture Development Method (ADM) is foundational for setting up the architecture effort. As you mentioned, it focuses on defining the "where, what, why, who, and how" of architecture within the enterprise. Let's break down each of these steps in the Preliminary Phase:

### 1. **Define the Enterprise**

* **Objective:** Understand the scope and boundaries of the organization and its key stakeholders. The enterprise could be a business, government body, or any other organization. This step involves identifying all relevant organizational structures and ensuring alignment with the architecture's goals.
* **Key Actions:**

  * Identify key stakeholders and their concerns.
  * Understand the business context and any strategic objectives that may influence architecture decisions.
  * Define the scope and boundaries of the architecture (e.g., enterprise-wide, specific departments, or business units).

### 2. **Identify Key Drivers and the Organizational Context**

* **Objective:** This step identifies the external and internal drivers that influence the architecture, ensuring that all decisions are context-sensitive.
* **Key Actions:**

  * **External Drivers**: Market conditions, regulatory requirements, competition, technological trends.
  * **Internal Drivers**: Business strategy, corporate governance, performance measures, risk factors, and culture.
  * Understand how these drivers will shape architecture decisions.
  * Determine the specific needs of different business units or areas of the organization.

### 3. **Define the Requirements for Architecture Work**

* **Objective:** Clearly outline the requirements for the architecture effort to ensure that it aligns with organizational objectives and stakeholder expectations.
* **Key Actions:**

  * Define the scope and focus of architecture activities (e.g., strategic, tactical, or operational).
  * Define key deliverables, milestones, and timelines for the architecture.
  * Identify required resources (tools, technologies, skilled personnel).
  * Establish the processes and governance needed to execute the architecture work effectively.

### 4. **Define the Architecture Principles**

* **Objective:** Establish a set of guiding principles that will inform all architectural decisions and ensure consistency across the architecture.
* **Key Actions:**

  * Develop principles related to technology, data, business processes, security, and governance.
  * Ensure alignment with the organization’s overall vision and values.
  * Define principles related to issues like flexibility, scalability, standardization, and reusability.

### 5. **Define the Framework to be Used**

* **Objective:** Choose the appropriate framework that will structure the architecture development. This step ensures that the right methodologies and tools are applied throughout the process.
* **Key Actions:**

  * Define the specific architecture frameworks or methodologies (e.g., TOGAF, Zachman, FEAF, or custom frameworks) that will guide the development.
  * Establish guidelines for how each phase of ADM will be structured and how tools and techniques will be applied.
  * If needed, adapt existing frameworks or create a hybrid approach based on organizational requirements.

### 6. **Define the Relationships Between Management Frameworks**

* **Objective:** Identify how various management frameworks (e.g., project management, IT service management, business process management) will interact with the enterprise architecture.
* **Key Actions:**

  * Establish relationships between architecture frameworks and other management processes.
  * Ensure that architecture work integrates with other corporate governance, project management, and operational processes.
  * Define processes for communication and feedback between architecture and other business areas.

### 7. **Evaluate the Enterprise Architecture Maturity**

* **Objective:** Assess the current maturity level of enterprise architecture within the organization to identify gaps and areas for improvement.
* **Key Actions:**

  * Use a maturity model to assess the current state (e.g., initial, managed, defined, optimized).
  * Analyze existing architecture practices, tools, and governance structures.
  * Identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas where new capabilities need to be developed.

### 8. **Determine the Architecture Capability Desired by the Organization**

* **Objective:** Define the level of capability required from the architecture function in the enterprise.
* **Key Actions:**

  * Align architecture capabilities with business needs and strategic objectives.
  * Identify the skills, competencies, and resources required to meet these capabilities.
  * Define what kind of architectural competence is needed in the long term and how it will evolve.

---

Each of these steps is designed to lay a solid foundation for the architecture development process, ensuring that it is well-aligned with the organization’s strategic goals, governance structures, and overall maturity. These steps collectively help to ensure that enterprise architecture is not only effective but also sustainable and adaptable to future changes.
