# üèóÔ∏è Architecture Levels: Strategic, Segment, and Capability

TOGAF organizes the enterprise architecture landscape into **three levels of granularity** to help manage complexity and change effectively. Each level addresses different scopes and audiences and supports the overall enterprise transformation.

## 1. **Strategic Architecture**

* **Purpose:**
  Provides **high-level direction** and vision for the entire enterprise.
  It defines the **long-term objectives, guiding principles, and key business capabilities** that the organization aims to develop or enhance.

* **Scope:**
  Enterprise-wide or large-scale, across all business units and functions.
  Includes broad **business goals**, **technology trends**, and **major investments**.

* **Audience:**
  Senior executives, enterprise leaders, and board members.

* **Output:**
  Enterprise-wide architectural vision, principles, and strategic roadmaps.

* **Example:**
  Deciding to become a ‚Äúdigital-first‚Äù bank in the next 5 years, investing in cloud, AI, and mobile banking capabilities.

---

## 2. **Segment Architecture**

* **Purpose:**
  Breaks down the strategic architecture into **manageable parts (segments)** aligned to a business unit, domain, or value stream.
  Supports **planning and execution** at the program or portfolio level.

* **Scope:**
  Focused on specific **business segments** such as retail banking, loans processing, or supply chain management.

* **Audience:**
  Program managers, architects, and business leaders responsible for that segment.

* **Output:**
  Detailed architecture and roadmaps for the segment that align with the strategic goals.

* **Example:**
  Developing an architecture roadmap for the retail banking segment to implement mobile check deposit and digital loan approval.

---

## 3. **Capability Architecture**

* **Purpose:**
  Focuses on **specific capabilities or technology components** required to deliver incremental business value.
  Supports the **development and implementation** of solutions that realize parts of the segment architecture.

* **Scope:**
  Narrow, often project-level or technology-specific.

* **Audience:**
  Solution architects, project teams, and technical leads.

* **Output:**
  Detailed architectures for capability increments such as a new payment gateway, customer portal, or data analytics platform.

* **Example:**
  Designing the architecture for a new AI-based fraud detection system as part of the banking segment‚Äôs digital transformation.

# üîÑ How They Work Together

| Level          | Focus                                 | Scope                   | Audience                             | Example                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Strategic**  | Enterprise-wide vision and principles | Entire enterprise       | Executives, Enterprise Architects    | Digital-first transformation plan |
| **Segment**    | Business unit or domain architecture  | Business segment/domain | Program managers, Segment Architects | Retail banking mobile app roadmap |
| **Capability** | Specific capability or solution       | Project or capability   | Solution architects, Dev teams       | AI fraud detection system design  |

---

### Summary:

* **Strategic Architecture:** sets the **big picture and long-term direction**.
* **Segment Architecture:** translates strategy into **actionable roadmaps** for business areas.
* **Capability Architecture:** delivers **concrete solutions and increments** supporting segment goals.


Here‚Äôs a clear visual diagram and example for the **Architecture Levels (Strategic, Segment, Capability)** explained above, using a **Food Delivery Application** case study to make it relatable:

## Example Explanation:

### 1. Strategic Architecture (Enterprise-wide)

* Senior leaders decide FoodieGo will lead the market by offering the fastest delivery service.
* They prioritize investing in cloud infrastructure and AI for better routing.
* Set overall digital transformation goals and guiding principles.

### 2. Segment Architecture (Delivery & Logistics Segment)

* The architecture team focuses on the delivery and logistics part of the business.
* They create a roadmap to launch a courier mobile app and integrate AI routing.
* This segment architecture aligns with the strategic goal but is scoped to delivery operations.

### 3. Capability Architecture (AI Routing & Courier App)

* Solution architects design the AI routing system and features of the courier app.
* These architectures detail how to build, deploy, and integrate these components.
* They focus on delivering incremental value by improving route efficiency and delivery updates.
