# ðŸ§© Architecture Partitioning

**Definition:**
Architecture Partitioning means dividing the overall enterprise architecture into smaller, manageable parts called **architecture partitions**. This approach helps in **developing, governing, and managing** complex architectures more efficiently.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Partitioning**

   * Break down the large architecture into distinct partitions with clear **boundaries**, **ownership**, and **governance**.
   * Each partition represents a logical or organizational subset of the architecture (e.g., business units, domains, systems).

2. **Ownership**

   * Assign each partition to a specific **team or group** responsible for the architecture activities within that partition.
   * Each owning team executes the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) on their partition.

3. **Governance**

   * Establish governance mechanisms for each partition to ensure compliance, consistency, and alignment with enterprise standards.

4. **Reflect Enterprise Operating Model**

   * The way you partition should **reflect how your enterprise operates** â€” aligned with organizational structure, business domains, product lines, or geographical locations.

## Why Partition?

* Simplifies architecture development and management
* Enables parallel workstreams for different teams
* Provides clear accountability and ownership
* Scales enterprise architecture to large organizations

## Simple Diagram:

```
+--------------------------------------------+
|         Enterprise Architecture            |
|--------------------------------------------|
|   +---------------+  +------------------+ |
|   | Partition 1   |  | Partition 2      | |
|   | (Team A owns) |  | (Team B owns)    | |
|   +---------------+  +------------------+ |
|                                            |
|   +---------------+                        |
|   | Partition 3   |                        |
|   | (Team C owns) |                        |
|   +---------------+                        |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

* Each partition corresponds to a subset of the architecture.
* Each team runs their own ADM cycle within their partition.
* All partitions align under the enterprise architecture framework.

### Example (Food Delivery App):

* **Partition 1:** Customer Experience (owned by UX Team)
* **Partition 2:** Logistics & Delivery (owned by Operations Team)
* **Partition 3:** Payments & Billing (owned by Finance Team)

Each team manages their domain architecture but follows common enterprise architecture standards.
