 **BDAT Architecture Domains** in Enterprise Architecture — aligning with the **TOGAF® Standard (10th Edition)** and commonly used in real-world EA practice.

---

## 🧱 TOGAF® Architecture Domains – BDAT Model

The **BDAT model** refers to the **four key architecture domains** used in TOGAF to describe different aspects of an enterprise. These domains are typically addressed across the **Architecture Development Method (ADM)** phases.

> 📘 **BDAT** = **Business, Data, Application, Technology**

Each domain answers **a different "what and how"** in the context of aligning business goals with IT systems and infrastructure.

---

### 1️⃣ **Business Architecture**

* **Purpose:**
  Defines the **business strategy**, **governance**, **organization**, and **key business processes** of the enterprise.

* **Key Focus Areas:**

  * Business goals and objectives
  * Business capabilities and functions
  * Organizational structure and roles
  * Business processes and workflows
  * Business services offered to customers or internally

> ✅ Business Architecture sets the **direction and requirements** that drive the other architecture domains.

---

### 2️⃣ **Data Architecture**

* **Purpose:**
  Describes the structure of an organization's **data assets**, including their **conceptual**, **logical**, and **physical representations**, as well as the data management resources required to manage them.

* **Key Focus Areas:**

  * Data models (conceptual, logical, physical)
  * Data entities and relationships
  * Data governance and stewardship
  * Metadata and master data management
  * Data quality, security, and compliance

> 📊 Data Architecture ensures the **right data is available**, **well-structured**, and **properly managed** to support business and applications.

---

### 3️⃣ **Application Architecture**

* **Purpose:**
  Provides a **blueprint for individual applications** to be deployed, their **interactions**, and their **relationships to core business processes**.

* **Key Focus Areas:**

  * Application portfolio and lifecycle
  * Application integration and interfaces (APIs, services)
  * Functional roles of applications
  * How applications support business capabilities
  * Interoperability and reuse

> 🧩 Application Architecture ensures that systems are **aligned with business needs**, **modular**, and **integrated** for agility and efficiency.

---

### 4️⃣ **Technology Architecture** (also called **Infrastructure Architecture**)

* **Purpose:**
  Describes the **digital architecture** and the **logical software and hardware infrastructure** required to support the deployment of **business**, **data**, and **application** services.

* **Key Focus Areas:**

  * Servers, networks, storage, and cloud infrastructure
  * Technology standards and platforms
  * Middleware, operating systems, runtime environments
  * Virtualization, containerization, and hosting models
  * Infrastructure security and performance

> 🖥️ Technology Architecture defines the **technical capabilities and standards** that enable all other domains to function efficiently.
