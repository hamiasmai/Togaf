## üèõÔ∏è **What is Enterprise Architecture (EA)?**

**Enterprise Architecture (EA)** is a discipline that enables organizations to **align business strategy with IT infrastructure and operations**. It provides a **structured approach** for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise transformation.

---

### üîç Let‚Äôs Break It Down:

To fully understand **Enterprise Architecture**, we must define two terms: **Enterprise** and **Architecture** ‚Äî as defined by **ISO/IEC/IEEE** standards and the **TOGAF¬Æ Standard**.

---

### üè¢ **What is an Enterprise?**

> "**An enterprise is any collection of organizations that has a common set of goals**."
> ‚Äî *TOGAF¬Æ Standard, 10th Edition*
>
> "**An enterprise is the highest level (typically) of description of an organization and typically covers all missions and functions**."
> ‚Äî *ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011*

**In simple terms:**
An *enterprise* can be a **whole company**, a **department**, a **government agency**, or even a **collaboration between organizations** ‚Äî as long as they share common goals.

### üèóÔ∏è **What is Architecture?**

> "**Architecture is the fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution.**"
> ‚Äî *ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011*

> "**Architecture is the structure of components, their interrelationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time.**"
> ‚Äî *TOGAF¬Æ Standard, 10th Edition*

**In simple terms:**
Architecture describes **what makes up a system**, **how the parts fit together**, and **how they change over time**.

### üìò **So What Is Enterprise Architecture?**

> "**Enterprise Architecture is a discipline that provides principles and practices to guide organizations through business, information, process, and technology changes.**"
> ‚Äî *TOGAF¬Æ Standard, 10th Edition*

> "**Enterprise Architecture defines the structure and operation of an organization, aiming to determine how an organization can most effectively achieve its current and future objectives.**"
> ‚Äî *ISO/IEC/IEEE interpretations*

## üí° In Simple Terms:

> **Enterprise Architecture is the blueprint of an organization ‚Äî showing how its business goals, processes, applications, data, and technologies all fit together and evolve.**
