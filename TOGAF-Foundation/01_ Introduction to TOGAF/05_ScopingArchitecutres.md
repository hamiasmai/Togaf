Absolutely! Here's a concise explanation of **Scoping Architectures** within TOGAF fundamentals, covering **scope details** like domains, time, and constraints, along with a simple diagram to visualize it.

## üß≠ Scoping Architectures in TOGAF

**Scoping** defines the boundaries and extent of an architecture effort, answering:

* **What** will be architected?
* **How deep** should the architecture go?
* **Which domains** are involved?
* **For how long** will this architecture be valid?

---

### 1. Enterprise Scope (Breadth)

* Defines **the size and boundaries** of the architecture effort.
* Examples: Entire enterprise, a business unit, department, or a specific process.
* Questions:

  * Which organizations or units are included?
  * Are we focusing on all or just part of the enterprise?

---

### 2. Level of Detail (Depth)

* How detailed should the architecture be?
* Balances between **high-level strategic views** and **detailed system design**.
* Avoid over-engineering‚Äîenough detail to meet stakeholder needs.

---

### 3. Architecture Domains

* Which domains will be included in the scope?
  TOGAF defines four key domains:

  * **Business Architecture** ‚Äî business processes, capabilities, organizational structure
  * **Data Architecture** ‚Äî data models, management, governance
  * **Application Architecture** ‚Äî software systems, interfaces, services
  * **Technology Architecture** ‚Äî infrastructure, platforms, networks

---

### 4. Time Period (Planning Horizon)

* Defines the **timeframe** the architecture covers.
* Could be short-term (1 year), medium (3 years), or long-term (5+ years).
* Helps decide **how detailed** and **how proactive** the architecture should be.
