# 🧠 **TOGAF Architecture Abstraction Levels**

In TOGAF, **Architecture Abstraction Levels** help architects think **logically and systematically** about the architecture they’re designing — from **purpose and requirements** to **implementation**.

Each level **answers a specific question** about the architecture:

| Abstraction Level | Question         | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Contextual**    | **"Why?"**       | Why does the architecture exist? What is the business **context and motivation**?                |
| **Conceptual**    | **"What?"**      | What does the architecture need to achieve? What **capabilities and services** are needed?       |
| **Logical**       | **"How?"**       | How should the system be structured logically? What **components and relationships** are needed? |
| **Physical**      | **"With what?"** | With what physical systems, hardware, platforms, or software will we implement it?               |

## 🍔 Real-World Example: **FoodieGo - Food Delivery App**

Let’s walk through these levels for a new **Order Tracking Feature** in the **FoodieGo** app.

---

### 1. 🧭 **Contextual Level** (WHY?)

> The **business motivation** and context.

* **Business Goal:** Improve customer satisfaction with real-time order tracking.
* **Drivers:** Customer feedback showed frustration with delivery uncertainty.
* **Stakeholders:** Customers, delivery partners, support team.

---

### 2. 🧠 **Conceptual Level** (WHAT?)

> What **capabilities and services** are needed?

* **Capabilities Needed:**

  * Track delivery status in real-time
  * Notify customer of delivery progress
* **Business Services:**

  * Order Dispatching
  * Delivery Progress Update

---

### 3. 🧩 **Logical Level** (HOW?)

> How should we design the architecture **logically**?

* **Components:**

  * GPS Tracking Service
  * Notification Service
  * Customer Order Portal
* **Data Flows:**

  * Real-time location updates from courier app to central system
  * Push notifications to customer app

---

### 4. 💾 **Physical Level** (WITH WHAT?)

> What **technologies/assets** will be used?

* **Mobile App:** Courier app uses built-in GPS
* **Cloud Services:** AWS IoT for real-time tracking
* **Database:** MongoDB for tracking delivery status
* **Front-End:** Flutter app for Android/iOS customers
