# **Architecture Development Method (ADM) – Overview**

The **Architecture Development Method (ADM)** is the core of the **TOGAF® Standard**, used to develop and manage the **lifecycle of an Enterprise Architecture (EA)**.

## 🔍 Key Characteristics of the ADM

1. **Core of TOGAF** – Central to the standard, guiding all EA efforts.
2. **Tested and Repeatable** – A reliable process used across industries.
3. **Architecture Framework** – Establishes a consistent framework for architecture efforts.
4. **Content Development** – Supports the creation of both architectures and architecture content.
5. **Governance** – Oversees realization and transition of architectures.
6. **Iterative Cycle** – Enables continuous definition and realization of architecture.
7. **Business-Aligned Transformation** – Drives change in a controlled, goal-oriented way.
8. **Step-by-Step Method** – Consists of **10 phases**, 8 arranged in a cycle.
9. **Adaptability** – Can be tailored for different enterprise needs and architecture styles.
10. **Not Waterfall** – No strict phase order; phases can be revisited and run in parallel.
11. **Reference Models** – Supports solution delivery through modeled components and relationships.

## 🧭 ADM Cycle Overview

The ADM consists of **10 phases**, arranged as an **iterative cycle**:

### 🔹 **Preliminary Phase**: Establish Architecture Capability

* Prepares the organization for architecture work.
* Customizes the TOGAF framework.
* Defines Architecture Principles.
* Establishes governance and readiness.

---

### 🔹 **Phase A: Architecture Vision**

* Starts the architecture development cycle.
* Defines **scope**, **objectives**, and **stakeholders**.
* Develops the high-level Architecture Vision.
* Secures **approval** to proceed.

---

### 🔹 **Phases B, C, D: Architecture Development**

These phases develop detailed architectures to support the Architecture Vision:

1. **Phase B: Business Architecture**

   * Describes current and target business capabilities and processes.

2. **Phase C: Information Systems Architectures**

   * **Data Architecture**: Defines data assets and structures.
   * **Application Architecture**: Describes application landscape and interactions.

3. **Phase D: Technology Architecture**

   * Identifies required technology infrastructure.

Each phase defines **Baseline and Target Architectures**, addressing current vs future states.

---

### 🔹 **Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions**

* Begins implementation planning.
* Identifies **solution building blocks** (delivery vehicles).
* Aligns proposed solutions with business priorities.

---

### 🔹 **Phase F: Migration Planning**

* Develops a **detailed implementation and migration plan**.
* Defines transition architectures.
* Aligns changes with capacity, risk, and business timelines.

---

### 🔹 **Phase G: Implementation Governance**

* Provides **architectural oversight** during implementation.
* Ensures realization aligns with the architecture vision and requirements.

---

### 🔹 **Phase H: Architecture Change Management**

* Establishes procedures for handling **change**.
* Ensures architecture evolves with business needs.

---

### 🔁 **Requirements Management (Continuous Phase)**

* Runs **throughout the ADM cycle**.
* Manages requirements across all phases.
* Ensures changes to requirements are reflected and governed.
* Maintains alignment with stakeholders’ needs.

---

## 🧾 Outputs and Artifacts

* Each phase generates **outputs** (e.g., documents, models, principles).
* Outputs have defined **statuses** (Draft, Approved, Finalized).
* Outputs from earlier phases may be updated in later phases.

---

## ✅ Summary

The TOGAF ADM provides a **structured, flexible, and iterative approach** to developing Enterprise Architecture. It supports:

* **Consistent architecture delivery**
* **Adaptation to business change**
* **Governance and stakeholder alignment**
* **Integration with requirements and implementation plans**
